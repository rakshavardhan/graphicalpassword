Graphical Password Authentication System
ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Graphical Password Authentication System is a secure login mechanism that replaces traditional text-based passwords with graphical-based authentication. Users select a sequence of images or patterns instead of typing a password, making it more resistant to brute-force and dictionary attacks.

ðŸ›  Features
âœ… Secure image-based authentication
âœ… Customizable image selection process
âœ… Resistance to keyloggers and brute-force attacks
âœ… User-friendly and visually appealing UI
âœ… Optional two-factor authentication support

ðŸ“· How It Works
User Registration:

The user selects a sequence of images or clicks on specific points in an image.
The selected pattern is securely stored using encryption techniques.
User Login:

The user must recreate the exact image sequence or pattern.
The system verifies the input against stored credentials.
Authentication:

If the sequence matches, access is granted.
If incorrect, access is denied after multiple failed attempts.
